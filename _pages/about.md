Hello! I am Harsh. 

I have been working as a Data Scientist in the Ministry of Rural Development, Government of India since 2016. Prior to that I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer with Aspiringminds' using data science to make the post-college employment pipeline more just and equitable. In 2018, I was selected as a fellow for University of Chicago's Data Science for Social Good program in which I worked with Dutch Government to predict accidents on their highways to optimize patrol plans of first responders.

`Submitted please for your perusal and further action` is how most official government notings in files are summarized by junior officers before being passed upwards and onwards.
